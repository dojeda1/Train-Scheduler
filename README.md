# Train Scheduler

### About this Project

This app displays a list of trains and their arrival times stored on Firebase. For each train, the time until next arrival is calculated using the first arrival time, frequency of the train, and the current time. The user can also add a train to the Firebase database by completing a form at the bottom of the screen.
